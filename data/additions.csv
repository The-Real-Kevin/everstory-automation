Turtles can be found nearly all over the world and can live in many places—some like to swim in water, while others live on land. Tortoises' feet are similar shapes to elephants' feet for walking on land, and turtles' feet are webbed for swimming. If a turtle feels scared, it can pull its head and legs inside its shell to hide. Fossils show that turtles have been living on Earth for more than 200 million years! Turtles come in many sizes, shapes, and colors. Tortoises and turtles eat plants, but many turtles also eat a variety of other creatures including insects and fish.

A sock often looks like a stretchy cloth tube or bag with a closed end for the toes and foot and an open end that pulls up to the ankle or leg. Socks protect the skin on feet by helping keep feet dry and a comfortable temperature. People make socks out of many materials and in many sizes and designs. People in Egypt and Greece used pieces of cloth or animal skin around their feet to make socks more than a thousand years ago.,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8QrVE4tg7DgfkXgRAZseQS8TIy4XkMT/view?usp=sharing,500,1500,Egypt,"31.208870° N, 29.909339° E",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mcyJ8D2iex3F8liWxQPkC93JqhFZn6Gf/view?usp=sharing,https://unsplash.com/photos/a-pair-of-colorful-socks-sitting-on-top-of-a-bed-sYgzIZKxqyA,,"foot, warmth, shoes, cotton, elastic, polyester, cashmere, toes, wool, tights, sweat, skin","foot, clothes, toes, shoes, wool, cotton, polyesther, nylon, boots, sandals, sweat, skin, tights, cashmere, elastic, pantyhose, ","Chatgpt

Usually a doctor or nurse will use a syringe with a small needle to give a person a vaccine shot in their arm or leg. Sometimes, it can also come as drops that you swallow. A vaccine, also called an immunization, helps your body learn what some bad germs called viruses or bacteria are like, so your body can practice and get better at fighting them. The first vaccine was made over 200 years ago by Edward Jenner in England to stop people from getting a disease called smallpox. Today, vaccines are used all over the world to help protect people from many different diseases and illnesses, and people are making new vaccines to protect against new diseases.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dLvsE-Y37bYEDP7FFg4hhC_kBs4IYDqL/view?usp=sharing,1796,200,England,"52.908° N, 2.372° W",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FcivA7hT5fTvkpHz0k3r6VFSEUxVHgBB/view?usp=drive_link,https://www.nm.org//-/media/northwestern/healthbeat/images/covid-19-medical-advances/nm-dos-donts-covid-vaccine_feature.jpg,Northwestern Medicine,"nurse, doctor, virus, bacteria, sickness, disease, shot, medicine, syringe, immune system, hospital, Edward Jenner","vaccine, shot, medicine, syringe, needle, immune, immunity, immunization, disease, bacteria, virus, viral, bacterial, DNA, RNA, MRNA, doctor, nurse, hospital, Edward Jenner, 200 years ago","https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/a-brief-history-of-vaccination
