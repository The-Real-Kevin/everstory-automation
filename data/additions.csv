Looking at a Petoskey Stone, especially if it's wet or polished, you can see gray or brown six-sided shapes that fit together like a puzzle. These shapes were once the tiny little homes where the coral animals lived! Each circle with a dot in the middle was one tiny coral creature.

A Petoskey stone is really a fossil–the remains of an under-water coral animal that lived about 350 million years ago! Long ago, Michigan was covered by a warm, shallow sea, and these corals lived there. When the corals died, they sank to the bottom of the sea and over millions of years, they slowly turned into stone.

A sock often looks like a stretchy cloth tube or bag with a closed end for the toes and foot and an open end that pulls up to the ankle or leg. Socks protect the skin on feet by helping keep feet dry and a comfortable temperature. People make socks out of many materials and in many sizes and designs. People in Egypt and Greece used pieces of cloth or animal skin around their feet to make socks more than a thousand years ago.,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e8QrVE4tg7DgfkXgRAZseQS8TIy4XkMT/view?usp=sharing,500,1500,Egypt,"31.208870° N, 29.909339° E",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mcyJ8D2iex3F8liWxQPkC93JqhFZn6Gf/view?usp=sharing,https://unsplash.com/photos/a-pair-of-colorful-socks-sitting-on-top-of-a-bed-sYgzIZKxqyA,Sandy Millar on Unsplash,"foot, warmth, shoes, cotton, elastic, polyester, cashmere, toes, wool, tights, sweat, skin","foot, clothes, toes, shoes, wool, cotton, polyesther, nylon, boots, sandals, sweat, skin, tights, cashmere, elastic, pantyhose, ","Chatgpt
